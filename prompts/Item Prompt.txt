just an FYI, I have introduced the concept of a cave, it will funtion like a volcano area, Hard level monsters high spawn rate.

Perhaps we should get started on the Item management. 

Please remember that all state should remain on the server, and be sent to the clients for viewing - no actions taken on the client should affect game state without validation server side.

Weapons and Armor are required for the monster encounters and battles. Items are available to the user during their turn.

When a player starts, they start with a "Fist" weapon,  no armor and no items.

*for now - to test, I would like to gift each player a random item from the biome set when they land on it.

When a user is gifted a new item, they are shown a popup with the title "You found a ___" item details and a modal asking them to "equip" or "stash" if it is armor or weapon, and stash if it is an item.

other players joined the game on their screens also see the modal, however they do not have any buttons and it will say "Player X found a ____" with a 5 second timeout and a button to dismiss.

each player will have a collection of weapons and armor which (similar to changing profile, they can change out by clicking the weapon slot, or armor slot)
they will also need an Item slot which can exist bottom left of the screen under a button called "Use Item"

Each item will have a item id (which can be used to render the item picture on the clients), and item type "weapon", "armor", "item", a spawn biome, an attack value, and a percentage to hit as a number between 1 to 6, where 1 means it only hits if the user rolls a 1, and 6 means it hits if the user rolls a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6

Items that can exist are:
Teleport - teleports the user to the nearest town.
Small Health Potion - heals for 3 hearts
Medium Health Potion - heals for 5 hearts
Large Health Potion - heals for 7 Hearts
Full Health Potion - heals all hearts
Additional Heart - gives the user another heart.
